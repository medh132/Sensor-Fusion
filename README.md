**Problem Statement and objective:**
The central problem to be addressed is the unbounded accumulation of errors (drift) in
displacement and velocity estimates generated by purely data-driven, single-sensor Inertial
Measurement Unit (IMU) systems, particularly those that use deep learning to regress
velocity (like RoNIN). While Deep Learning models (Temporal Convolutional Networks,
Transformer) excel at pattern recognition and compensating for non-linear IMU errors,
they lack the state-space modeling and optimal recursive estimation capabilities needed
to maintain long-term stability and optimally fuse the learned velocity with a dynamic
motion model.
Hence, the overall objective of this work is to test different deep learning–Kalman filtering
framework for inertial velocity regression that reduces drift and improves trajectory
accuracy. To this end, the main goals of this project are as follows:
1. To integrate a Kalman Filter with the temporal convolution network and fuse network
predictions with a motion dynamics model, aiming for smoother trajectories
and reduced transient errors.
2. To investigate transformer architecture for inertial velocity regression and compare
performance gains when fusing a Kalman filter based dynamics model.
3. To compare the hybrid model (feature fusion of TCN and Transformer) and study
the performance gains when integrated with Kalman filter.
